This project implements the classic Towers of Hanoi problem using assembly language for the RISC-V architecture.

<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

The Towers of Hanoi problem involves moving a series of disks of different sizes from a source tower to a destination tower, using an auxiliary tower, while following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty tower.
3. The goal is to move all the disks from the source tower to the destination tower.

This project implements a recursive algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem in RISC-V assembly.
